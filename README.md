=============================PARAGRAF 1  
With deep learning, we’re still learning a function f to map input X to output Y with
minimal loss on the test data, just as we’ve been doing all along. Recall our initial
“problem statement” from Part 2.1 on supervised learning:  
=============================PARAGRAF 2  
The real world is messy, so sometimes f is complicated. In natural language problems
large vocabulary sizes mean lots of features. Vision problems involve lots of visual
information about pixels. Playing games requires making a decision based on complex
scenarios with many possible futures. The learning techniques we’ve covered so far do
well when the data we’re working with is not insanely complex, but it’s not clear how
they’d generalize to scenarios like these.  
=============================PARAGRAF 3  
Deep learning is really good at learning f, particularly in situations where the 
data is complex. In fact, artificial neural networks are known as universal function
approximators because they’re able to learn any function, no matter how wiggly, with
just a single hidden layer.
