The real world is messy, so sometimes f is complicated. In natural language problems
large vocabulary sizes mean lots of features. Vision problems involve lots of visual
information about pixels. Playing games requires making a decision based on complex
scenarios with many possible futures. The learning techniques we’ve covered so far do
well when the data we’re working with is not insanely complex, but it’s not clear how
they’d generalize to scenarios like these.
